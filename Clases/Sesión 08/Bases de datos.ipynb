To get the most out of their large and complex datasets, users require tools that simplify the tasks of managing the data and extracting useful information in a timely fashion. Otherwise, data can become a liability, with the cost of acquiring it and managing\n",

    "A database management system, or DBMS, is software designed to assist in maintaining and utilizing large collections of data. The need for such systems, as well as their use, is growing rapidly. The alternative to using a DBMS is to store the data in files and write application-specific code to manage it. Es es sin duda poco práctico, y debe evitarse.\n",
